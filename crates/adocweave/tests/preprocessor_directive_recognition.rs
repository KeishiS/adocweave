//! Preprocessor directives reaching an analysis that did not preprocess.
//!
//! The preprocessor consumes `ifdef`, `ifndef`, `ifeval`, `endif` and `include`
//! before parsing. An analysis that skips preprocessing still receives the
//! lines, and before this recognition existed the block grammar handed them to
//! the inline parser: `ifeval::["a" == "b"]` was read as a macro whose leading
//! `ifeval:` looked like a URL scheme, so the reader was told the URL was
//! rejected. These tests fix what the reader is told instead.

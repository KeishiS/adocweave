//! Lint rule identifiers reached through the public API.
//!
//! A rule is written in two hand-maintained places: the catalog macro that
//! defines its constant, and the re-export list in the crate root.
//! `unprocessed-directive` was released with only the first, so the rule
//! produced diagnostics but consumers could not name it. Naming it by string
//! still worked, and that is the failure mode these tests exist to prevent: a
//! renamed rule then goes unnoticed until a document is accepted that should
//! not be.
